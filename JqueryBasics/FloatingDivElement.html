                Eusèbe Jaojoby (born 29 July 1955), commonly known by his surname Jaojoby,
                <br /><br /> 
                is a composer and singer of salegy, a musical style of northwestern Madagascar. 
                <br /><br />
                Critics consider him to be one of the originators of the modern salegy style that 
                <br /><br />
                emerged in the 1970s, and credit him with transforming the genre from an obscure 
                <br /><br />
                regional musical tradition into one of national and international popularity.
                <br /><br />                 
                Jaojoby also contributed to the creation of two salegy subgenres, malessa and baoenjy. 
                <br /><br />
                Jaojoby has been called the most popular singer in Madagascar and the Indian Ocean 
                <br /><br />
                islands, and is widely referred to as the "King of Salegy".
                <br /><br />
                His success has earned him such honors as Artist of the Year in Madagascar for 
                <br /><br />
                two consecutive years (1998–1999) and the role of Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Population Fund in 1999.
                <br /><br />
                In 1972 Jaojoby began singing in the northern coastal town of Diego-Suarez.
                <br /><br />
                He performed with bands that were experimentally blending American soul and funk with the Malagasy musical traditions of the region. 
                <br /><br />
                The artist gained popularity and toured regionally, producing four singles with 
                <br /><br />
                The Players before the band broke up in 1979. After a short break in the 1980s 
                <br /><br />
                to pursue a career in journalism, Jaojoby resumed his musical career and rose 
                <br /><br />
                to national prominence with his 1988 hit "Samy Mandeha Samy Mitady." 
                <br /><br />
                He then reoriented his career toward music, recording his first full-length 
                <br /><br />
                album in 1992 and becoming a full-time professional musician the following year.
                <br /><br />
                 He has since released eight full-length albums and has toured extensively in 
                <br /><br />
                Madagascar and abroad accompanied by his wife and adult children, who perform 
                <br /><br />
                in the band with him.
